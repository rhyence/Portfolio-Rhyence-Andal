This project examines whether a person's level of education influences their health literacy, defined as their ability to understand and apply health-related information. Patients are grouped by their highest level of education: uneducated, primary, secondary, and tertiary. Their health literacy scores range from uneducated to extremely educated. A one-way ANOVA was conducted to determine if the differences in health literacy across education levels are statistically significant.
